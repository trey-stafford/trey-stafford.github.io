As expected, today started early. With the airport shuttle expected at 6AM, I
awoke just before 5 to ready myself for the day to come. After packing my things
and having a quick bite of the hotel's breakfast, I went out into the dark and
chilly morning to await the bus where it dropped us off the day before.

Given the other delays I've encountered, it was no suprise that the bus was a
little late picking us up (15 minutes - but it felt much longer!). Thankfully,
the rest of the morning went as planned and I boarded the flight for Ilulissat
on-time.

One silver lining of my flight being pushed back a day was that my rebooked
flight was direct to Ilulissat. If things had gone accordding to plan yesterday,
I would have had short stops in Maniitsoq and Sisimiut. This saved me about an
hour on the plane!

This morning I checked out of my hotel in Ilulissat at 9:30AM. This would be my
final day in Ilulissat, and it left me with a bittersweet feeling. On the one
hand, I was reluctant to leave this beautiful place - the land of the Big
Ice. On the other hand, I look forward to the week to come in Nuuk. I'm not done
with Greenland yet!

My flight back to Nuuk was scheduled for 6:30PM, so I had some time to pass
between checkout and heading to the airport. I put my luggage in the hotel
luggage room and set off for the ILLU Science and Art Hub for more Ilulissat
Science Forum events.

The morning session was about "Climate and Ecosystem Changes" and featured talks
from a local hunter, a Greenlandic scientist who specializes in the dynamics of
the icefiord ecosystem, and a climate scientist from the Danish Meterological
Institute. A panel discussion followed the presentations, which was moderated by
[Twila
Moon](https://nsidc.org/about/about-nsidc/what-we-do/our-people/twila_moon), the
Principal Investigator for the
[QGreenland-Net](https://qgreenland-net.github.io/) project that I work on and
ultimately brought me to Greenland.

After this morning session, we had a 1.5 hours lunch break that I used to visit
the [Ilulissat art museum](http://www.museum.gl/Ilulissat_kunst-1). Although
small, I really enjoyed spending the lunch break viewing artwork from [Emanuel
A. Petersen](https://guidetogreenland.com/about-greenland/greenland-today/emanuel-a-petersen-an-artistic-account/)
and others before returning to ILLU.

The afternoon session at ILLU was focused on responsible tourism in Greenland,
which I felt was a good way to cap off my week of tourism! The session included
discussion about the changing nature of tourism in Ilulissat, which has shifted
from relatively small numbers of tourists who had many opportunities for 1:1
interactions with local tour guides to the mass tourism of today in which
thousands of tourists overwhelm the capacity of local guides, requiring new
infrastructure (e.g., hotels) and tourism opportunities (large companies that
hire temporary seasonal workers who only live in Ilulissat for a few months a
year). I learned that some 60k tourists visit Ilulissat each year, and the
number is expected to grow substantially (upwards of 100k) within the next few
years. Indeed, a new international airport is expected to open in Ilulissat in
October of 2026, which will facilitate this boom in tourism. Remember - only
about 5k people live in Ilulissat (and 3k sled dogs)!

Once the afternoon session wrapped up, it was about time for me to head to the
airport and then back to Nuuk. The sun was setting on my Ilulissat adeventure.

Thankfully, my flight departed on time and without any issues! I arrived in Nuuk
just after 8PM, checked into my hotel, and immediately went out for a late
dinner at a nearby Thai restaruant.

I do not currently have any specific plans for tomorrow. Starting Monday, I will
begin attending [Greenland Science Week](https://www.scienceweek.gl/) events on
behalf of the QGreenland-Net project. I look forward to meeting other scientists
and Greenlanders over the next several days as I engage with them about
QGreenland and science in Greenland.
